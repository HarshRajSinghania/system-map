# Backlog

What's left, written so another agent can pick it up cold. Nothing here is started.

## Before you start

- Everything so far is on stacked branches with no `main` and no remote. Work from the tip,
  `slice-8/find-agents`, on version 0.10.0.
- Run the checks in the README's Checks section. All pass at the tip: 805 Python tests and
  100 UI tests.
- Agents can't log in to the dashboard. `ui/dev` stands in for the host, so a person has to
  press Sync and look. Say what has and hasn't been seen for real.
- Look at screenshots before you commit UI. Checks have passed while pictures showed faults.
- Hold every number to the tool that owns it: the compiler, real Postgres, real SQLite, a real
  `next build`, git. Prefer a sweep over a hand-written fixture.
- Read each check's own exit code. A pipe to `tail` has hidden failures here.
- Host rules are in `docs/platform-notes.md`. Only names in the host's vendor stubs may be
  imported, and any other name fails the whole app at load.
- No personal, employer or private project names in this repo or its history. Anything that
  needs one goes in `.local/`, which git ignores.

## Check in the real dashboard

| Check | How | Why it is open |
|---|---|---|
| Project picker | Sync, then click another project in the header menu | Fixed in `8126792`, proven only in `ui/dev` |
| Show button | Press Hide on Map or Data model, then Show modules or Show tables | Hide was seen for real, Show was not |
| Folder window on a Mac and Linux | Press Browse on each | Only WSL has run for real. The others are stubbed |
| Design chat opens on its first message | Sync, open a project with no chat, leave, and look for no New Session. Then send a message | Proven only in `ui/dev`, whose chat is a stand-in |
| Agents after review | Sync. Turn the Agents layer on and off from an open area. With it on, open a saved view from Explore: the button must go off. Pick a filter whose count is 0, and look at a disabled Agents button on a project with no agents | The tab, layer, Show on map, regions, bands and region findings were seen for real, in the light theme. The review fixes since `3ceff3e` were not. The saved-view rule lives in App wiring, which no test loads |
| Agents in the side panel and dark theme | Open the panel tab on an agent, and switch the theme | Not looked at yet |
| Find my agents | Sync. On a project with no agent settings, press Find my agents and approve `draft_agents` in the chat. The card must show within 8 seconds. Try Edit first then Cancel, Edit first then save, Drop, and Use these. Press Find my agents again while a card shows, and check that Use these on the old card is refused. Look in light and dark | Its routes, tool and skill were proven on a real project by 3 runs of a fresh agent through the MCP server. No screen of it has been seen |

## Small fixes

| Fix | Where | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| Singular wording: "0 of 1 files", "1 of 1 worktrees have changes" | `ui/src/Risk.tsx:42`, `ui/src/Worktrees.tsx:183` | One thing reads as one, with a test |
| Table list labels: "at work" is vague, and two numbers have no heading | `TableList` in `ui/src/parts.tsx` | Someone new can read a row without hovering |
| Scope document is out of date | KiroCrew artifact `system-map-app-scope` | It says slices 0 to 6, and drops the done risk and store items |

The numbers in a table row are findings, then columns. Hovering shows that, and nothing else does.

## Planned features

From the scope document. Each needs a short spec first, kept as an artifact like
`system-map-slice-6-spec`.

| ID | Feature | Priority | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| A3 | Decisions attached to nodes | Soon | Intent layer, so it survives rebuilds |
| A4 | Export decisions and proposals as files | Soon | The app never writes them to a repo itself |
| C6 | Sub-agents get ids and paths, write results to files and return a path | Soon | See `docs/context-management.md` |
| M6 | Scheduled refresh | Later | Crons and `permissions.spawn` are in the SDK, not tried |
| E6 | Agents propose Intent edits for you to accept | Later | Drafts work for proposals only. Only a person may accept |
| G2 | Agents from SDKs: Claude Agent SDK, OpenAI Agents, LangGraph, Mastra | Soon | Found with no settings. Hold each reader to the SDK's own types |
| G3 | Evals and guardrails beside each agent | Later | No sign in code says what is an eval or a budget yet. Cut from slice 7 |

## Store listing

| Step | Note |
|---|---|
| Public repo with a `main` branch | Decide how the stacked branches land on `main`. Keep `ui/dist` committed |
| Publish check of all git history | Scan every commit and message, not just the tip. The first copy of the slice 7 spec named a private project, in `a0fdf04` and the commits after it until task 7 |
| Listing request | An issue on the Kiro Crew repo. A maintainer writes the catalog entry |

## Known limits

These are named on screen, not hidden. Each is a choice, not a bug.

| Limit | Where | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Uncommitted work doesn't show | `GitSource` in `core/sources.py` | A git repo is read at the main branch's last commit, and requirement M7 says so. Reading a checkout needs a spec. `TreeSource` already reads folders with no git |
| Prisma with no SQL migrations gives no tables | `_unread` in `core/read.py` | Its schema isn't SQL, so it needs its own reader. Hold it to the tool's generated SQL, as `scripts/sweep_drizzle.py` does |
| Drizzle for Postgres or MySQL gives no tables | `core/extractors/drizzle.py` | Only `sqliteTable` is read. Its calls don't link either, and the build names the gap |
| Drizzle schema built by running code | `unread` in `core/extractors/drizzle.py` | Loops, `sqliteTableCreator`, custom column types and defaults from variables are named by file and line, never guessed |
| A repo with SQL files and a Drizzle schema | `replay_source` in `core/extractors/sqlite.py` | SQL gives the tables, even if the schema has moved on. Drizzle still gives the code links |
| Drizzle `with: { guest: true }` adds no link | `drizzle_uses` in `core/extractors/typescript.py` | Only calls that name a table count, on both sides of the compiler check |
| A parameter named like an imported table | `drizzle_names` in `core/extractors/typescript.py` | Text can't see scopes, so `function f(users) { Array.from(users) }` links. `ts_truth.mjs` catches it |
| Worktrees and Drizzle schema edits | `tables_at` in `core/extractors/drizzle.py` | Deleting a whole `sqliteTable`, or editing a helper a table spreads, marks no table. The shared file still shows |
| Stored or virtual generated columns | `table_shard` in `core/extractors/sqlite.py` | The model only says a column is generated, for every kind of schema |
| Monorepos | `_unread` in `core/read.py` | A Next.js app in a subfolder is named, not read |
| MySQL and MongoDB | `core/extractors/` | Each needs its own module behind the boundary |
| Limits on what-ifs are Postgres only | `limits_apply` in `core/explore.py` | They are proven against real Postgres. SQLite needs its own sweep |
| SQL built from pieces at runtime | `sql_uses` in `core/extractors/typescript.py` | Only SQL seen as one whole string links to its tables |
| Agents need settings | `settings_of` in `core/agents.py` | With none, there are no agents, only suggestions and Find my agents. G2 would find SDK agents with none |
| An agent named as a plain argument | `_hand_offs` in `core/agents.py` | `startJob("setup", "hello")` starts nothing on the map. Only a property named in the hand-off keys counts. Every Find my agents run on a real project found this gap |
| Asks you from SQL | `asks_you` in `core/agents.py` | An agent that runs in the database and leaves a person a task through a SQL function is not marked. Only calls in an agent's own code count |
| A model called through a passed-in object | `_calls` in `core/agents.py` | It links to every model the project uses, since text can't tell which one is passed in |
| An agent that shares its file with others | `_regions` in `core/agents.py` | It gets its own object and the files its names are imported from. A handler written in that same file, outside the object, is not read |
| Asks you, or only tells you | `asks_you` in `core/agents.py` | A call to an asks-you name counts either way. Telling the two apart needs the call's arguments |
| A job that starts an agent two calls deep | `find` in `core/agents.py` | Only the job's command and the one SQL function it calls are read |

## Screen walks

The walks that drive `ui/dev` name private projects, so they stay out of git, in `.local/walks/`.
Its README says how to run them. Bringing them in needs public fixtures in place of those
projects, and a `playwright-core` that isn't tied to one machine. Until then, the stand-in host
in `ui/dev` is the only part of them in this repo.
